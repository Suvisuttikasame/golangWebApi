A small application help me whle learning go. Just mark key point & score for each topic lesson, it's a checkpoint to remind what I've learnt also realize weak and strong point in any part.
In order to use an app, need to prepare docker container, some node package and table.
1. run docker-compose up to install and run docker container.
2. run yarn to install all dependency packges.
3. create a table in postgres "mytable".
Then an app is ready to use.
